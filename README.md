# LazyCal

A journey into the wild world of xcode and swift, LazyCal is my experiment with ios apps. A basic calculator with a twist, Lazy Cal does all your basic mathematical operations with ease...until of course it gets tired. A loss of patience and lack of interest leads to an onslaught of smart comebacks and witty retorts. Rationale: It looks good on a portfolio...? The app was designed and developed into what currently is its alpha stage. I have decided to leave at that in order to recreate the app within react native. I would eventually like to publish the app on multiple platforms. A walkthrough video is listed below and the source code is included for anyone to play around with.
